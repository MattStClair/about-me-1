    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p>   As a former Marine, I strive to be challenged.  If i fail the challenge, I'll adapt and search for my faults until i can accomplish the challenge.</p>
    <p>   The first time I put myself to the test was in bootcamp in 2009.  The economy had crashed and my family was scattered to the winds.  While I was in bootcamp I kept telling myself to be like my friends that had already made it through.  I would think of them and hear my other friends saying "haha we knew you couldn't make it".  It could be my desire to be accepted in society or my tendency to avoid conflict but in the end I told myself i wouldn't be weak.  I never gave up.

    <p>   The second time I was pushed to my limits was in 2013. I was in my first amateur fight in Muay Thai and matched against my close friend.  He took it as an opportunity to hit me as hard as he could.  I had to look into myself to see him as the enemy for the meantime and find a solution.  I found his weak spot and won the match by first round TKO.  That gave me a new perspective to solving a problem without bias.

    <p> The third even took place in my own head.  I was on my last deployment with the worst leaders and coworkers anyone could ask for.  Unfortunately, rank hierarchy prevented me from giving them their due justice and I had to find a way of coping with it.  That's when I found poetry.  I was able to write down everything I had bottled up and over the years found better ways to make it all sound better.  Poetry helps me remain calm and keep my emotions to myself so I can maintain a professional profile and get a job done.
